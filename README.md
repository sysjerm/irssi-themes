<B>usage</B><br />

<br /><br />
<B>why doesn't it look like the screenshot?</B><br />
screenshots are user-contributed. they contain a lot of information which is not part of the theme file:<br />
- background colour and image<br />
- font face and base colour<br />
- additional scripts such as: nicklist, window list, nick colouring script.<br />
- in most cases, the authors only sent in the theme files and none of those additional material.

<B>why is my irssi in a foreign language?</B><br />
several themes have translated all irssi messages into the author's language, however, you are able to edit those themes yourself.
